# About

A React live-streaming app that I did as part of my React course. I did the project to solidify my understanding on the following React concepts:
1. Navigation with React Router.
2. Handling authentication in React.
3. Redux Dev Tools.
4. Handling forms with Redux Form.
5. REST-Based React Apps.
6. React portals.
