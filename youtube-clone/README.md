# About 

A React YouTube clone which I first created using class based components then redid it using functional components. It helped solidify my understanding on the following React concepts:
1. Differences between class and functional based components.
2. Structuring apps in react.
3. State and useState.
4. Lifecycle methods and useEffect.
5. Handling user inputs with forms and events.
6. Making API requests in react.
7. Building lists of records.
8. Using refs for DOM access.
